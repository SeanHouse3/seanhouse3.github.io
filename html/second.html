          <p>
              During my second year at Western Colorado University I had just swicthed my major to Mathematics and my advisor recommended that I took the upcoming special topics class
              on fractals. The premise of the class was to learn how fractals occured in math and in nature. Recreating several famous fractals like, Serpinski's Triangle, 
              in the program Mathematica. The final project for the class I decided to persue Circle Inversion because I thought they were the coolest looking fractals.

              The black and orange image next to this is an example of one of the fractals I created using circle inversion. Unfortenetly I don't have the code used to create this one.
              The general idea was to create several circles with a starting point in one of the circles. Then 
              randomly selecting a circle you invert the point and repeat that until a picture is formed.

          <p>
              For my Senior Capstone project I decided to recreate the proof of Marden's Theorem from a paper written by Dan Kalman. 
              This was my second project and University, but I put about 60 more hours into this than my circle inversion project.
              For this project I did a lot of my calculations and figures in a program called Geogebra.
